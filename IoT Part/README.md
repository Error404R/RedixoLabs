# Smart Agro Project 

-------------------
## About Project
Smart Agro Project is an IoT kit consists of several sensors that takes realtime readings from formers field and sends alerts over the text messages/email/calls to farmers when needed to act .

## DEMO
### IoT Kit Demo

 > Our model have several sensors that takes readings from farmers field through microcontroller . We've set thresold minimum and maximum values for each sensors when sensor values will be out of thresold values, then we'll send alerts.
In demo, we've used temperature & intensity sensors, here temperature value is less than the minimum thresold value, so simply we are turning on electric motor(LED for demo) and sending alerts over text message .
